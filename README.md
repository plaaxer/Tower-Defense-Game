# Tower Defense Game made utilizing Pygame and Object Oriented Programming;

- Made for the course "Objected Oriented Programming 2" at the Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil, with two friends (@GustavoVonn and @pedro-fmm).
- A considerable portion of the code, including functions and variables, is in portuguese, though its meaning should be somewhat understandable. That varies a lot throghout the project, however.
- The design pattern utilized was that of State-Control.
- Great inspiration from the youtube channel CodeWithRuss to learn the Pygame library and get some assets.
- Rest of assets obtained on opengameart.org, while maps where created using Tiled.

# Features:
- Restart, pause, and tips sections.
- Two different types of towers (easily expandable).
- Three different types of enemies (easily expandable)
- Fast forward button to make the round end faster.
- Can process any type of map made on either Tiled r a similar software.

# Updates:
- Balanced the turrets, enemies and waves. Made the enemy spawn cooldown slighly random.
